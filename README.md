# Odin Etch-a-Sketch

This is a practice project to demonstrate DOM manipulation via JavaScript, as part of The Odin Project's [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

DOM manipulation is used to generate the grid through the addition and removal of nodes, as well as changing the colour and opacity of each grid cell on mouse hover.
